A set of saved repository changes.
A commit is never lost.

A commit is always the same.

To Commit :
Let's go ahead and create a commit on our repository. Open a command prompt and go into the project we created earlier.
Let's create a file add some text to it. Whether you're on Windows or Mac you can type
echo Hello world > Readme.md and the name of the file, which is Readme.md

let's go ahead and create a commit from these changes.We'll do this with two commands.
git add . -> git add adds all the files that we have changed to the staging area.
             The dot at the end tells git to add all the files that have changed.
git commit -> The git commit command simply creates a new commit. The -m "Initial commit" adds a comment.
              git commit -m "First commit"
git log    -> This command shows us a list of the commits in our project.
